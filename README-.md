## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

1.  if want to write text in the right and the left side of the box,then add flex to the display property of the box and then add a <hr> tag to make it look like one.
<!-- reaction            89/100 -->
2.  add padding to make the text a little centered of the curved box.
3.  most imp learning ,to make responsible website make the width of the grids of constant sizes otheswise, flexwrap is of no use in case of relative sizing.

```html

```
